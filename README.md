# calculateYT-PlaylistDurationCSV<br />
it goes through an entire playlist, calculates the duration and saves it to an csv file<br />
i fixed file creation, just set the default(permanent) folder if u plan on turning this to a bat file <br />
VVV<br />
THE CSV FILE MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE PYTHON SCRIPT<br />
the csv file must have<br /> VIDID,LENGHT<br />
as the first line,using the lenght part and pandas we calculate the total duration<br />
you have to create your own yt3 API key<br />
